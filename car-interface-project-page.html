		<span class="sub-title" style="color: #0f5ccc; font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;">Kathleen</span><span class="sub-title"> is the first persona that the interface was designed around. She is a busy on-the-go mother of four who 
		is constantly in her car. Between her husband and her kids, she requires full access to her phone to keep in touch with all of them and their obligations. She needs the interface to be simple so that she does not
		need to constantly think about it while she's thinking about a hundred other things during her busy day.</span>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<span class="sub-title" style="color: #0f5ccc; font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;">Grace</span><span class="sub-title"> is a common personality that would use the interface. She's an 18 year old college student who is constantly
		on her phone, whether it's texting her friends, listening to music, or browsing social media. Due to the risks of texting and driving, Grace is aware that she cannot be on her phone while behind the wheel, so she needs an interface
		that will allow her to stay in touch all of her friends and listen to her music.</span>

		<span class="sub-title" id="infoArch" style="color: #0f5ccc; font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;">Jim</span><span class="sub-title"> is another personality who the interface was designed for. Jim is a successful businessman who

			<div class="title-2"  style="padding-top: 1vw;">Using the <span style="font-weight: 700;">Phone</span> Component</div>
			<br/>
			<div class="sub-title">This is a low fidelity wireframe of the phone component. The wireframe begins at the main home screen. It then flows to the main phone screen, where the many other phone options are. The first being
			the standard phone call screen, which allows for regular voice phone calls. Another option is the Phonebook, where the user can select from a grid-like view of circular contact options. From there, they can select which 
			phone number of the contact they'd like to dial. </div>
			<br/>
			<div class="sub-title">There are several more options in the phone screen, such as the messaging options. This was specifically designed with the Grace persona in mind and more specifically, so that all users can be safe
			drivers and keep their hands off their phones while driving. </div>

		<br/>
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<div class="title-2" style="padding-top: 1vw;">Using the <strong>Audio</strong> Component</div>
			<br/>
			<div class="sub-title">Another important aspect of the interface is the audio component. From the home screen, the interface flows into the current song that is playing, gives information about it, provides all audio functions
			such as play, rewind, fast forward, and shows the source of the audio. If the user decides to switch the audio source, he can directly access it from this page by pressing the button in the lower left hand corner. From here, he
			will be taken to the main sources page in which he can toggle his sources.</div>
			<br/>
			<div class="sub-title">The sources page provides easy and simple ways to adjust audio settings. Seeing as majority of all smart phones are connected via Bluetooth, this interface has chosen to make that the primary source input.
			The user can easily switch between Bluetooth devices by selecting a listed device or by selecting to connect a new one. From here, the new device is paired and brings the user back to the list of sources.</div>

				<div class="sub-title">This case is a bit different in that the user is disconnecting a device that already exists in the car. This important when looking at personas like Grace, who wish to be able to easily disconnect/reconnect
				different devices.</div>

				<div class="sub-title">The user can select new message from the menu, and then go through a series of movements where he can first (1) select the contact via the phonebook page and then second (2) choose between auto-reply
